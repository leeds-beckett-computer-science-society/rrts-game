# RRTS Game
This project was created by the computer science society at leeds beckett university. Everyone is free to contribute.

This project contains 2 sub-projects which exist to separate the game from its framework. The purpose of the framework is to create a really simple library for the game to use and effectively hide the boilerplate code. 

# Requirements
The project already has all of the libraries added as git submodules but it currently gets the libraries through compile flags. This means you will need to install the libraries yourself outside of the project.
- GLFW
- GLEW
- Emscripten (for web)
